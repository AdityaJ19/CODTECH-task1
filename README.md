Description of the project: The Simple Calculator project is a desktop application developed in Java, leveraging the Swing framework for the graphical user interface (GUI). This application aims to provide users with a straightforward and intuitive tool for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features and Functionality
The calculator features a clean and user-friendly interface with a display panel and a grid of buttons representing numbers (0-9) and basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /). The GUI is designed to resemble a traditional handheld calculator, making it familiar and easy to use.

Display Panel: The display panel at the top shows the current input, ongoing operations, and the results of calculations.
Numeric Buttons: Buttons for digits 0-9 allow users to input numbers.
Operator Buttons: Buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division enable users to perform arithmetic operations.
Function Buttons: Clear (C) button to reset the input and delete (DEL) button for correcting the last entered digit.
Implementation Details
The project is structured with an emphasis on modularity and clean code practices:

GUI Design: Created using Java Swing components such as JFrame, JPanel, JButton, and JTextField. Layout managers like GridLayout are used to organize the buttons and display panel.
Event Handling: Action listeners are implemented to handle button clicks and perform corresponding arithmetic operations. The ActionListener interface captures user interactions, processes inputs, and updates the display.
Arithmetic Logic: The core logic for arithmetic operations is encapsulated in methods that handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The input from the user is processed and the result is computed and displayed in real-time.

User Experience:
The Simple Calculator ensures a seamless user experience with responsive buttons and real-time display updates. Users can perform multiple operations sequentially, with intermediate results displayed instantly. The design prioritizes ease of use, making it accessible to users of all ages.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates effective use of Java Swing for GUI development, integrating essential programming concepts such as event handling and modular design. The Simple Calculator serves as a practical tool and a solid foundation for learning and expanding Java-based GUI applications.
